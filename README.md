# Baloo

**Know what's in your food.** Paste a supermarket product link and Baloo streams back a calm,
plain-language breakdown of every ingredient — what it is, why it's in *that* product, a
Natural/Processed tag, and any listed %. From there, products can be saved into shareable lists and
discovered through the people who curate them.

Baloo **explains, it never scores.** No health score, no rating, no traffic lights — ever. That
guardrail is the whole point, and it's enforced in [`PRODUCT.md`](PRODUCT.md) and
[`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md).

> **Status:** the ingredient tool (Phases 1–2) is live and the community platform (Phase 3 —
> accounts, lists, profiles, discovery, comments, moderation) is built and being hardened toward a
> beta. See [`Baloo_Launch_Plan.md`](Baloo_Launch_Plan.md) for what's next.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in keys (see below); all are optional to boot
npm run dev                  # http://localhost:3000
```

The app **boots with zero environment variables** — every piece of infrastructure (Claude,
Firecrawl, Redis, Postgres, email) is optional in code. With no keys you get the full UI; set
`MOCK_PIPELINE=1` to walk the whole reading → streaming → results flow without spending anything. Add
keys to switch on the real pipeline and the community features.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Dev server on :3000 |
| `npm run build` / `npm start` | Production build / serve |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` (also runs in CI on every push) |
| `npm run db:generate` | Generate a Drizzle migration from `lib/db/schema.ts` |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Apply migrations to `DATABASE_URL` |
| `npm run db:seed` | Seed demo data (products, users, lists) |
| `npm run db:check` | Read-only assertions against the live DB |

## Environment variables

All server-side unless noted. Full annotated list in [`.env.example`](.env.example).

| Variable | Needed for | Optional? |
|---|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Ingredient analysis (Claude) | Required for live analysis |
| `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` | Scraping product pages | Required for live analysis |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Postgres (accounts, lists, catalog) | Optional — no DB → tool-only mode |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` / `_ANON_KEY` | Supabase Auth (client) | Public **by design** (safety is RLS, not key secrecy) |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Server-side ingestion/admin | Optional (with `DATABASE_URL`) |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` / `_TOKEN` | URL cache + the homepage board | Optional |
| `LOOPS_API_KEY` | Email capture | Optional |

**Never** prefix a secret with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. The two Supabase `NEXT_PUBLIC_` vars are the single
deliberate exception — the Supabase model makes them public and relies on Row-Level Security.

## How it works (at a glance)

```
Paste URL ─▶ /api/extract ─▶ Firecrawl scrape ─▶ Claude extract ─▶ header + ordered ingredients
                  │                                                         │
          (L1 Redis cache, URL-keyed)                            /api/analyze ─▶ Claude streamObject
          (L2 Postgres, identity-keyed:                                   │
           known product → skip analysis)                        cards stream to the client
                                                                          │
                                                          persisted to the catalog (product page, lists)
```

A successful analysis is stored **once** per real product (deduped on a canonical key) and reused
everywhere — the product page, other retailers' listings, and any list it's added to. The full model
is documented in **[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

## Deploy (Vercel)

```bash
npx vercel            # link/create the project
npx vercel --prod     # deploy (env vars via the dashboard)
```

Add caching from **Vercel → Marketplace → Upstash Redis** (it injects the Upstash vars). Connect
**baloo.life** under Domains once the launch checks in [`Baloo_Checklist.md`](Baloo_Checklist.md)
pass. CI (typecheck + build) runs on every push via [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml).

## Notes

- Model `claude-sonnet-4-6`, set in [`lib/config.ts`](lib/config.ts).
- Pinned to the **AI SDK v4** line (`ai` ^4, `@ai-sdk/*` ^1); see [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) before upgrading.
- The `lib/` pipeline is deliberately framework-agnostic so a future mobile app can reuse it.
